 >> Okay, first I'm going to give you your item analysis for your benchmarks.
 >> I'm a third grade teacher and we are working this week with my grade level team and partner
 around the latest data that the district has issued for us, a benchmark, a reading benchmark.
 >> I think the consider is when we gave the first benchmark that's when we stopped them
 at the end of every story.
 >> At World of Inquiry School we've made data a priority.
 We have specialists with roles whose job it is to gather, coordinate the data, share it
 with us at grade level meetings and we're given a forum to discuss it openly with a group
 of colleagues.
 >> Okay, 29 for Richie, 30 for Schlee.
 >> Before coming to the meeting, I've already analyzed and spent time with the data.
 >> First, why don't we do this?
 >> Take your time to kind of digest your data, okay, so I'll give you a few minutes for
 that.
 >> One of my goals was to get the teachers to focus on specific standards, that I was
 aware that they needed to spend some time on.
 >> I heard you say author's purpose, huge, okay, so that's one of them, inferring, correct?
 And then under that should be context clues.
 >> And as you can see, we have a lot of twos right here as well, okay.
 >> One thing that stood out to me that I know I talked about in the grade level is how poorly
 the kids did on a context clue question.
 >> How much do we do that?
 And so now I want to go back and look at the questions really better.
 >> So most kids picked copy, which is true, trace can mean happy, but not in her fingertips.
 >> Finger tips trace along the wall.
 >> I know these are things that they have a lot of practice with and I know that we've
 built some great strategy for them to think more on this.
 >> Okay.
 And one of the things I used to do was in the passage, I have them underlying the sentence
 before.
 >> Sandra mentioned having them underlying the sentence in which they found it and the
 one before and after that, which is not normally what I have them do, so I'm going to just
 try that.
 >> And see if they could pick out the work you need.
 >> So constantly the sentence.
 >> The test data was pretty much indicative of where I thought the students would be performance-wise.
 And now I know instructionally by looking at the item analysis that we have to work on
 context clues and some author's purpose questions.
 >> Okay, so now we're on look at individual students results.
 What stands out to you?
 We'll say 70 is the cutoff.
 >> So percent.
 >> Yup.
 >> Jayla and Michael surprise me that they're struggling that much, but I know that they
 struggle with higher level thinking.
 Sharian has moved up, Dylan is still my highest intervention, but he's making really great
 gains.
 He has some of the first type words now.
 >> For students who I'm seeing a big discrepancy or if they're performing below grade level
 in general, I make it a point to make sure I see them daily in a small group or individually
 based on what I see their needs are.
 >> Now let's go to the data wall here because this is the next thing we need to do.
 I really want you to focus on where your kids fell on the benchmark and where they were
 in September.
 Blue is above grade level.
 >> The great thing that comes out of looking at this data wall at these great level meetings
 is the discussion, the rich discussion, seeing where as a whole grade level where these students
 fall.
 >> Carolyn, most of your kids here are really the kids that were in the twos.
 >> So from our meeting on Tuesday we talked about what we found out by looking at your
 baselines, we graphed the data between your first baseline and your second one to see
 how you did and remember one of the many things I love about our school is just how we all
 have a common focus around data and looking at how students perform and using that to
 help us be better teachers.
 >> And that's referring to the text details.
 So obviously this person understood the story, but maybe--
 >> As a classroom teacher, if it were up to me to put the data together myself and look
 through it on my own time, I don't know that I would be as effective because it's just
 one more thing to do and although it's very beneficial, we know that it's hard to find
 time.
 >> These are all of our-- this is all my data because I like to have it to look at to tell
 you exactly what we found out.
 >> It just really not only helps us work better as a staff team, but it helps us work better
 as individual teachers and grade levels to just best meet our students.
 >> So the recipe we had two problem areas, this question and this question.
